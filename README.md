<!-- jsfun2 uses examples/algorithms from FreeCodeCamp -->
<!-- to start, I changed launch.json to include "programs":"${file}" to run current file with f5 -->
<!-- Note: it will likely need to be changed to ${workspace folder}\\index.js like jsfun if testing within a browser. -->
<!-- Prettier "fix on save" appears to work, even though I was using react previously. -->
<!-- yarn add --dev eslint prettier eslint-config-airbnb@^latest eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@^latest -->
<!-- the above will get eslint to work correctly, except do not include react and jsx -->
<!-- everything appears to be in working order -->
